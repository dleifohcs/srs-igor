 A collection of data analysis macros for Igor Pro:

 SRS-STS: functions written to analyse and manipulate STM and CITS data

 SRS-SPECS: functions written to analyse and manipulate photoelectron 
 spectroscopy data

=============================================================================
 
SRS-STM: This is a project that I continue to work on slowly, and that is 
still very much a work in progress.  It is for the analysis of scanning 
tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy data.  While there are many more 
useful packages for the analysis of image data, the strength of these macros
lies in the analysis of tunnelling spectroscopy data, especially in the form 
of 3D CITS data sets.   

SRS-SPECS: This is a collection of macros written for Igor Pro primarily for
the analysis of photoelectron spectroscopy data.  This project was started 
during a visit to the Soft X-Ray beam line at the Australian Synchrotron with 
Kane O'Donnell and Lars Thomsen.  In a relatively short time these macros 
developed into quite a useful tool for analysing our NEXAFS data, and Kane 
suggested making them available for use and modification via GitHub.  

I also follow Kane's advice and add the following: please feel free to use 
and/or contribute to these macros, but adhere to the GPLv3 licencing 
agreement. See the COPYING file for more details.  

I would be very interested to hear how you've used, modified or improved 
these macros.
